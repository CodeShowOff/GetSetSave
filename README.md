# GetSetSave

Single-repo app: Express backend serves React frontend.

## Run (development)
1. Install server deps:
   npm install

2. Install frontend deps:
   cd getsetsave-frontend
   npm install
   npm start   # runs React dev server (http://localhost:3000)

3. Run server with nodemon:
   cd ..
   npm run start:dev

During dev the React app proxies /api to http://localhost:5000 (see "proxy" in frontend package.json).

## Run (single host)
1. Build frontend:
   cd getsetsave-frontend
   npm install
   npm run build

2. Start server:
   cd ..
   npm install
   npm start
   # open http://localhost:5000

## Notes
- The backend uses youtube-dl-exec (yt-dlp). If you see `spawn ENOENT` or similar, install `yt-dlp` system-wide or allow bundled binary execution.
- You are responsible for using the app only for authorized content.
